* **Maintainability**: Modular and well-documented code for easy updates and feature additions.
* **Compatibility**: Support for latest versions of Android and iOS, various device sizes, and screen resolutions.

### 3. Design Phase:

#### Steps:

1. **Research & Inspiration**: Analyze competitors and gather design inspiration.
2. **User Flows**: Map out user journeys and interactions.
3. **Sketching**: Create rough sketches of main screens.
4. **Wireframes**: Develop low-fidelity wireframes for layout and structure.
5. **Prototyping**: Create interactive prototypes for testing user experience.

### 4. Build Phase:

#### Tools and Technologies:

* **Android Studio** (or Xcode for iOS): Integrated development environment (IDE) for building apps.
* **Java or Kotlin** (or Swift for iOS): Programming languages for writing app code.
* **XML** (or Storyboard for iOS): Designing user interface.

#### Steps:

1. **Set up the project**: Create a new project and configure initial settings.
2. **Develop the screens**: Follow wireframes to design screens and connect them with proper navigation.
3. **Implement functionality**: Code the logic for each feature (e.g., app blocker, grayscale mode, screen time control).
4. **Integrate external libraries**: Add libraries if needed for additional functionality.

#### Testing:

1. **Unit testing**: Test individual code units.
2. **Integration testing**: Test how code units work together.
3. **User testing**: Conduct alpha and beta testing with real users.

#### Deployment:

1. **Prepare for launch**: Optimize app size, performance, and compatibility.
2. **Publish the app**: Release on Google Play Store (or App Store for iOS).
3. **Monitor and update**: Continuously gather user feedback, fix bugs, and release regular updates.

Your project plan outlines a clear roadmap for developing the Digital Detox app, including essential steps, tools, and technologies. With this plan in place, you can effectively manage the development process and ensure a successful app launch.
